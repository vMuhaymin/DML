üêé Horse Management System (Django + MySQL)
üìñ Overview

This project is a Horse Management System built with Django and MySQL.
It allows two types of users ‚Äî Admin and Guest ‚Äî to interact with race, horse, trainer, and stable information through a simple web interface.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have installed the following:
- Python 3.x
- MySQL Server & Workbench
- Django
- mysqlclient

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

üß© Installation Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Open a terminal and run:

pip install django
pip install mysqlclient

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up MySQL

Open MySQL Workbench and start your MySQL server.

Make sure you have a database named horse_management.
You can create it manually if needed:

CREATE DATABASE horse_management;
USE horse_management;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS old_info (
    horseId VARCHAR(15) PRIMARY KEY,
    horseName VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    registration VARCHAR(50),
    stableId VARCHAR(15)
);


DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE delete_owner_and_related(IN p_ownerId VARCHAR(15))
BEGIN
DECLARE done INT DEFAULT 0;
DECLARE v_horseId VARCHAR(15);


-- cursor to collect all horses owned by this owner
DECLARE horse_cursor CURSOR FOR
    SELECT horseId
    FROM owns
    WHERE ownerId = p_ownerId;

DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = 1;

-- open the cursor
OPEN horse_cursor;

read_loop: LOOP
    FETCH horse_cursor INTO v_horseId;
    IF done = 1 THEN
        LEAVE read_loop;
    END IF;

    -- 1. delete raceresults rows for this horse
    DELETE FROM raceresults
    WHERE horseId = v_horseId;

    -- 2. delete ownership rows for this horse (from all owners)
    DELETE FROM owns
    WHERE horseId = v_horseId;

    -- 3. delete the horse itself
    -- this will also fire the trigger backup_horse_before_delete
    DELETE FROM horse
    WHERE horseId = v_horseId;
END LOOP;

CLOSE horse_cursor;

-- now remove the owner's own rows in owns (should already be gone, but safe)
DELETE FROM owns
WHERE ownerId = p_ownerId;

-- finally, delete the owner
DELETE FROM owner
WHERE ownerId = p_ownerId;

END$$
DELIMITER ;

4Ô∏è‚É£ Create Trigger
------------------------------------------------------
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER backup_horse_before_delete
BEFORE DELETE ON horse
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO old_info (
        horseId,
        horseName,
        age,
        gender,
        registration,
        stableId
    )
    VALUES (
        OLD.horseId,
        OLD.horseName,
        OLD.age,
        OLD.gender,
        OLD.registration,
        OLD.stableId
    );
END$$

DELIMITER ;

üß© THATS ALL TO COPY üß© 
------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Project Folder

1. From the compressed project files, extract the contents.
2. Locate the folder named DML.
3. Open that folder in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## If you clone it from github
# then >>cd DML/DB 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4Ô∏è‚É£ Check Database Connection Settings

Open:

DB/settings.py

Scroll down to the DATABASES section and make sure it matches your MySQL setup:

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'horse_management',   # Database name in MySQL
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',          # Localhost
        'PORT': '3306',               # MySQL default port
        'USER': 'root',               # Your MySQL username
        'PASSWORD': 'password',       # Your MySQL password
    }
}


üí° Check: Change "password" to your actual MySQL root password if it‚Äôs different.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Project

In the terminal inside VS Code:

cd DB
python manage.py runserver

Once the server starts, you‚Äôll see an address like:

Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

üóÉÔ∏è Notes

The project uses MySQL Workbench for database management.

A stored procedure and a trigger are already defined in MySQL:

delete_owner_and_related (stored procedure) (The one that u must copy)

backup_horse_before_delete (trigger to copy deleted horses into old_info) (The one that u must copy)
